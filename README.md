Industry: Social

# Challenge
The client, a US-based start-up, was looking for a Xamarin developer to take on the application for their video streaming service. The backend part was written on .Net. It was essential for the client to have the frontend part built on .Net too to achieve better integration and cost reduction.

When the client came to us, the application was already in active development phase. The client had some issues with the changes made in the code of almost completed solution. This resulted in a full application breakdown.

The previous team was lacking the expertise to resolve the issues. We provided our Senior Xamarin developer to join the existing team on a dedicated basis and help to lead the project out of the deadlock.

# Our solution
The service allows users to record quick video challenges up to 30 seconds and post them to social networks. Other people can view and pick up the challenges they want to join.

Our developer’s scope of work included:

Architecture improvement to ensure application maintainability and achieve better effectiveness. We decomposed and took some parts of the project in separate NuGet libraries.
Code refactoring.
Application modernization and feature development.
 
# Outcome
Our developer led the solution to the release stage and implemented all the planned functionality. We also made sure that it seamlessly integrates with the backend part.

The application allows video recording, voting, joining challenges, inviting users to take up your challenge, following the chosen challenges, chat with users and sharing it via social networks.
